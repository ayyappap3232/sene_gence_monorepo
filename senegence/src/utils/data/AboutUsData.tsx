        designation: "Joni Rogers-Kante Founder, CEO, and Chairwoman",
        description: `Joni Rogers-Kante is the visionary and driving force behind SeneGence®. Her dream of developing a company that gave women an opportunity to build their own business regardless of age, background, or education has become a phenomenal success, with offices in five countries and hundreds of thousands of Independent Distributors across the globe.

        Joni began her career at 16 years old, working for the Sav-On Corporation. By 23, she was the Assistant Manager of the highest-performing store in the Sav-On chain. Having learned from high-level management, buyers, and operations experts, she knew the corporate structure was not for her. Joni was introduced to a direct sales cosmetic company, and her 13-year career produced jewelry, cars, awards, trips, and recognition, and most importantly, a burning desire to create her own company. Armed with a plan and her business experience, Joni pursued her dream of becoming an entrepreneur. In 1999, SeneGence and its flagship product, LipSense®, were born. Joni’s guiding principle for the company every step of the way has been, “Choose to Live Life in Love and Abundance, and Then Work for It!”
        
        In the early days of the company, Joni traveled around the world with a team of scientists and botanists to find ingredients for SeneGence’s unique skin care and cosmetic formulas. Currently, Joni oversees the company’s overall vision and more than 500 employees in SeneGence’s U.S. offices, and she is actively involved with trips, events, and the development and marketing of new products and training programs.
        
        In 2020 alone, Joni was installed as a Board Member of the Direct Selling Education Foundation, and The Orange County Business Journal named her one of the area’s most influential business leaders and the owner of the largest woman-owned business in the county. In 2018, she received Direct Selling News’ Bravo Award and the Excellence in Entrepreneurship Award by the Orange County Business Journal. Joni is the Founder of SeneGence’s nonprofit organization, The Make Sense Foundation®, and is an active member of the Orange and Creek County communities. She is also the author of Million Dollar Lips.`
